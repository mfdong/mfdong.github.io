                I do journalism, code, and design, and believe that the needs of people
                should drive each of those disciplines.

                I'm a junior at Northwestern University studying all 
                three of those things. This past summer, I interned at The Washington Post,
                developing and designing 
                <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/election-results/north-carolina/" target="_blank">
                    live election pages.</a>
                This fall, I'm continuing at the Post as an intern in their computational
                journalism lab, researching and developing election-related projects.

                I'm currently looking for Summer 2020 internships in interactive journalism and / or design research. :)
