    <h1>Hi, Madison here! ðŸ‘‹</h1>
    <p>This website is under construction. ðŸ‘€</p>
    <p>I do journalism, code, and design, and believe that the needs of people
        should drive each of those disciplines.</p>
    <p>I'm a junior at Northwestern University studying all 
        three of those things. This past summer, I interned at
    <italic>The Washington Post</italic>, developing and designing <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/election-results/north-carolina/" target="_blank">live election pages</a>.

    This fall, I'm continuing at the Post as an intern in their computational
    journalism lab, researching and developing election-related projects.
</p>
<p>I'm currently looking for Summer 2020 internships in interactive journalism and / or design research. :)</p>
