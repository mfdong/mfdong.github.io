        Hi. This is not my portfolio site. My portfolio is <a href="https://www.madisondong.com/" target="_blank">here</a>. This is my space for tinkering with the web and coding for fun.
      </p>
      <p>
        Coding is something I do at a corporate job, but it's been hard to remember why I started doing it in the first place - after all, it's now my primary source of income. By using it as a form of self-expression, I'm trying to remind myself that I have passions, interests, and desires for this skill outside of money and survival: I like to make art. I like to entertain. I like to tell stories. I like to document my life. I like all of these things, and code is something I want to use to amplify, enhance, and combine these ideas.
      </p> 
      <p>With all that being said, welcome. Enjoy your stay.</p>
